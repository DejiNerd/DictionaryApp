# DictionaryApp
Fall 2015 ECE242 project. Project isintended to familiarize you with operations on arrays such as Sorting and Searching Algo-
rithms. The goal of the project is to design an cient dictionary database and implement a variety of
useful applications such as: searching a word, spell checking a text, or and anagrams of a word. The items
of the dictionary will be read from an input file. At first they are not ordered and you must then implement
and test the performance of two sorting algorithms: (i) insertion sort and (ii) enhanced insertion sort. A
shuffle algorithm that generates random permutations of the dictionary items, must also be implemented in
order to allow multiple testing and timings of the sorting algorithms. At the firrst execution the code output
include a menu containing all options:

#Setup
Import to your local IDE
Run the program. If you have ideas, please fork!!
Test .txt files are included. Please make sure these are in the same directory of the project.
Enjoy! 
Analysis between two sorting algorithms is also included
